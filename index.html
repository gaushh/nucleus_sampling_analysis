        <h1>Thresholding as a Decoding Strategy for LLMs</h1>
        <p><strong>Introduction:</strong> Decoding strategies such as Nucleus Sampling and Top-K Sampling have been instrumental in the success of LLMs.</p>
        <p><strong>Is Nucleus Sampling the best way to decode?</strong> We analyze the generated text from Nucleus Sampling to find some of its shortcomings and propose a new sampling strategy hoping to solve these problems.</p>
        <p><strong>We also experiment with a dynamic thresholding strategy based on perplexity.</strong></p>
        <p><strong>Qualitative Analysis for repetition:</strong> Prompt: Sep 4, 2015 - DeeJ</p>
        <p><strong>Nucleus Sampling:</strong> They're always fun moments to share. They're always fun moments to share.</p>
        <p><strong>Top-K Sampling:</strong> "While a lot of Destiny has been announced, we've had a lot of speculation about what the Guardian Assault will look like. You can now pre-order your very own Guardianship, and we're going to take a look at some of the features that will be available when it launches...</p>
        <p><strong>Weaknesses of Nucleus Sampling:</strong> The sampling method can miss out words with significant probability in fat-tailed distributions. This can impact the creativity of the model. Nucleus sampling can end up picking words with very low probabilities in thin-tailed distributions, leading to incoherent text.</p>
        <p><strong>Our Approach: Thresholding for decoding</strong></p>
        <p>We evaluate a threshold-based decoding strategy. The key idea is to use a threshold on the probability values of the tokens and sample from only tokens that have probabilities higher than the thresholding probability. The value of this can be a hyperparameter as well as adjusted based on perplexity as we discuss later.</p>
        <p><strong>How thresholding solves the previous shortcomings:</strong> Thresholding avoids the problems of top-k as the dynamically changing candidate pool is still obtained. Thresholding also addresses the problems of nucleus sampling by being robust to flat and skewed distributions that might cause issues.</p>
