More than 5,000 people attended "Women's March" in Seattle, Washington, on Saturday, Jan. 21, 2017. Thousands of people attended the "Trump in DC" protest, which started at Union Station and wound through downtown Washington. (Sarah L. Voisin/The Washington Post)

What do you call an anti-Trump protest that includes a march around the Capitol and an "advocacy rally"?

The president's first 100 days in office have been marked by a series of executive orders, procedural maneuvers and political skirmishes that have left political and policy leaders chilled, and even rethought Trump's core campaign promises.

I think this could be a huge opportunity for staking and other blockchain projects. It is still a prototype to be built using the existing code.


It also means that the project is still open source, though they are starting to add some of their own code and changes.

Same with me. I grew up in the southwest, so it's hard to relate to being in a place where someone is like... "GOD I'M SO DISGUSTED YOU'RE A JEW. I'M AN INCREDIBLE JEW!"


I also think it's just weird when we're conscious of it and then we're like "Fuck, I'm flattered you think I'm Jewish."


Also, I'm a lot more obsessed with Tila Tequila than I am with Jewish people. Same with me. I grew up in the southwest, so it's hard to relate to being in a place where someone is like... "GOD I'M SO DISGUSTED YOU'RE A JEW. I'M AN INCREDIBLE JEW!"I also think it's just weird

On Thursday, the U.S. Treasury Department filed a lawsuit against a man in Florida who was selling a fake Treasury check on Craigslist, and even offered to pay the buyer a $600 "fraudulent fee" to keep the scam going.

The person who posted the fake check, showed up at the Treasury Department Office of Inspector General's office on Thursday, and asked for a meeting, the federal agency said.

The person then went into the office, where he was met by a "borrower" who was pretending to be "Treasury's Office of Inspector General."

Dueling classes

This is a fun and popular class. We have 2 dueling classes. The first is a Hybrid class. She is built from a combination of all the classes. The first time you play a Hybrid class, you will be thrown into a two-player game. This class is very fun to play. Each player will have their own character, based on the class they chose. These classes are very tight and it will take some time to become accustomed to playing as a Hybrid class.


The second dueling class is a Dark Knight class. The Dark Knight class is built from an experienced Dark Knight. You will be thrown into a two-player game. The Dark Knight class is very fun to play. Each player will have their own character, based on the class they chose.

How did the game go?

I think it would have been better if you had seen more of the early game but then you'd have the late game. Not because I think it's bad, but because I don't think there's a lot of interesting stuff to do in late game.
