The Washington Post reports:

The University of Virginia's law school will not be accepting applications from new students until the Senate confirms President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for attorney general.

The decision comes after the school's board of trustees voted on Nov. 18 to reject the nomination of Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) to be U.S. attorney general. The school's dean, Teresa Sullivan, said she was "deeply disappointed" by the decision, which she said was based on concerns about Sessions' record on civil rights and voting rights.
