The next step is to remove the spring by gently pulling on the spring, which will release the spring. This is a little bit tricky, but if you're patient you'll get it.

You should now have a small amount of rust on the spring. It should be clear, but it could be cloudy if it's not. If it's cloudy, you can remove the spring with a razor blade or razor blade cleaner, or you can use a razor blade to remove the rust.
