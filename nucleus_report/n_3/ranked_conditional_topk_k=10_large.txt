The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a strong record of preventing and treating illnesses that can kill. For example, the agency prevented more than 300,000 deaths from influenza A (H1N1) in the United States in 2013 and the majority of deaths prevented by CDC were among children under 5 years old. In the U.S., nearly half of the people who died from influenza last year died among people who had not been vaccinated against the virus.

In the coming years, the researchers believe, solar prices will drop so low that even small projects such as a single solar cell could be profitable, potentially reducing the cost of solar power in the US by as much as 20 percent by the end of this decade.

High-waisted pants.

Strapless and high-waisted dresses, and skirts.

T-shirt styles.

According to the North Korean official, who spoke to The Telegraph on condition of anonymity, Kim Jong Un has a 'benevolent' attitude towards his people.

'He treats them well, and he's got a sense of humour, he's funny, he likes to have fun,' he said. 'There's no reason why the people should be in such a miserable situation, but they are.'
