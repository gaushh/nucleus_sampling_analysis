Yeah, it's one of those things that's like "Well, it's been two days, and it's still not solved" but that's because there's so many different theories about what happened, and the thread was shut down by the mods in a couple hours of it being up. It's not like they've been investigating it.

These are the old fit jeans from the 80's. They were too loose and we had to cut them down to fit. We had to go through the long fitting process and spend an extra $5 on a new pair. The only thing they are missing is the snap button on the back.

Nuclear Warning

Unlocks The Arma 3 Nuclear Warning DLC.

Cost: 0

+100% in missile velocity and 0% explosive radius

-25% damage to buildings

-50% speed penalty

+15% ballistic coefficient

The DLC version of this weapon is an all-around upgrade, providing a significant boost to the ballistic coefficient, the velocity, and the damage. The downside is that it takes up a slot in your loadout, and has a rather short range. The short range also makes it very easy to miss.

The sun's magnetic field is weakened by a massive burst of charged particles known as a coronal mass ejection (CME). When the sun's magnetic field is weakened, it can cause the corona, the hot plasma around the sun, to erupt from the sun.

A coronal mass ejection is an extreme event when a large volume of plasma erupts from the sun's surface. The plasma contains magnetic fields that are energized by the sun's magnetic field.

This image from NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory shows the coronal mass ejection that occurred on July 6, 2012, as seen from Earth.
