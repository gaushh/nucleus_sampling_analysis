The Vermont Department of Transportation has been trying to close the bridge for years, but the state has been unable to get a federal permit to do so.

The bridge is a key link between the two states, and it's been closed for years because of a series of problems, including a leaky concrete deck and a crumbling concrete bridge deck.

The bridge is also a major artery for the state's economy, with more than $1 billion in annual economic activity tied to it.

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is considering a rule that would require food manufacturers to report the calories in their products. The rule would apply to all food products, including those sold in vending machines, and would be voluntary.
