The story of the last week's mass shooting in San Bernardino, California, is a familiar one. On Tuesday, a man named Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, opened fire on a holiday party at a holiday party for Farook's co-workers at the Inland Regional Center in San Bernardino. Farook died in the attack, and Malik was killed in a shootout with police.

Hi,

I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'm curious if it's possible to get a hand on the highroller bubble in the middle of the night. I've never seen one before.

2. The Chronic

The Chronic is a classic album. It's the perfect example of what a great album should be. The production is so good that it's almost impossible to listen to without being moved. The lyrics are so good that you can't help but feel the pain of the people you love. The album is so good that it's hard to believe that it was released in the early '90s. It's a classic that I'm sure will be around for a long time.
