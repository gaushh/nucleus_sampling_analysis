The researchers have discovered that the brain's "information processing system" is not only responsible for processing information, but also for storing it.

"We have shown that the brain's information processing system is not only responsible for processing information, but also for storing it," said Dr. David L.

The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a single dose of the ketogenic diet (KD) on the body composition, body composition, and metabolic parameters of overweight and obese adults.

METHODS:

Twenty-four overweight and obese adults (age: 25-55 years) were randomly assigned to receive either a KD (n = 12) or a control diet (n = 12).
