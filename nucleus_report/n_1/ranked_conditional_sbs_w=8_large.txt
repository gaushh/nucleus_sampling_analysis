Canada needs to scrap the capital gains tax and slash corporate taxes as a way to enhance economic growth, Conservative leadership hopeful Maxime Bernier said Tuesday.

"The NDP should pursue a tax cap. So who says that there should be no capital gains tax?" Bernier, a former cabinet minister, said during a break from events in London, Ont.

The NDP has been advocating for a Norway style tax on foreign ownership in exchange for a "fair" corporate rate and for higher U.S. corporate taxation that takes Canada out of the controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership free trade deal.

Education Minister Christopher Pyne says cutting university research funding will be the "worst-case scenario" if the government's higher education reforms fail to pass the Senate.

The Coalition has proposed a new Research Future Fund to replace the $5 billion National Program of Excellence. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull says the fund will demonstrate positive changes in research outcomes.

But Mr Pyne says the $5 billion could finance not just jobs, but universities and other research educational providers. The tough terms are not available for confirmation until university funding audits are investigated if allegations of front-running are proved.

Not much else. The only difference is that with the acceptance of bitcoin, it's now open source. There was something very strange about Cyborg Dark lying there wearing the illusion of vacuum cleaning. Why should Bitcoin *not* be the beginning of an era of libertarian security, and we may have had the first "instant laundromat" in modern history? Not much else.

Trends in the use of remand in Canada

Let's define a remand as one in which chargeable base fees, attendance fees and postage charges continue to accrue. A'10% remand' is one in which charges are suspended for up to 3 months.

If the following conditions are met, a respondent is a 10% remand respondent:

After 3 months, charges were suspend for up to 2 and a half years.

Charges were suspended for at least 2 years, but in the aggregate did not exceed 5 years.

A payment of remand fees was made;,

After 2 years, charges were suspended for at least 3 months.

Depending on the number of remand respondents, "10% rebates" or "10% grants rider" is applied to remand fees. Applying this option, a respondent is charged a ministry rebate payment after only 2 years of chargeable base fees (if in fact base fees were charged after 3 months). A respondent is then charged
OlimoLeague is a weekly Korean online tournament for StarCraft II players.

The Tournament [ edit ]

The OlimoLeague is a weekly online tournament with cup competitions held throughout the week. It begins on the Saturday before the official release. Invitational cups will begin their cups on OlimoLeague's servers at 10AM KST (GMT+9), and each cup features a maximum of 12 players. In a smaller cup, a minimum limit of 12 players will be played in order to avoid the potential failure of players that are already in the finals. In order for a player to participate in a cup, they must be able to set up a match after they join the cup, and they cannot be randomly selected for that cup. The cup will begin with the admins starting the broadcast, and the ladder start time will be four, ten, or fifteen minutes after an operation is completed.

Tournaments follow any official StarCraft II competition gameplay guidelines. Best-of-five series series set up using Heart of the Swarm, a default map must be played
