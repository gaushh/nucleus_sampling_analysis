You start the game with a single golf club and can pick up a few extra options like the "Rabbit" ball to help improve your shots.

India's first Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) was launched on October 23, 2015, at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. The S-band and Ka-band SAR is a new generation of advanced radars which can detect and track objects in the Earth's orbit in a much faster time than other existing SAR satellites.

The SAR will be able to track objects from space at a rate of up to 10 times faster than existing systems and can track objects up to 20 times faster than existing systems.

The SAR can be used to monitor the movement of satellites and spacecrafts, track objects in the sky and determine the position of objects in space.
