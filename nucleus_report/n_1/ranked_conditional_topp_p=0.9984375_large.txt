Gavrilyaros said he previously experienced discrimination within the community when he joined the Greek Orthodox Church over a years hours holiday in Turkey.

Vertical Spark reports that an eyewitness who saw the major wildfire scene point to these massive flame patches to indicate that the forest was set on fire deliberately.

Yosemite National Park is currently experiencing massive forest fires impacting nearly 80,000 acres near the camp. The park is over loaded as traditional fuel generators are shut down as they become too dangerous to run. The area is looking dangerously close to being scrubbed dry.

We will not do that."

China says the missile system "affects our security interests directly and indirectly"

Chung says if Washington backs a U.N. resolution, China won't be bound by it

China says an international resolution prohibiting the deployment of ballistic missiles aimed at U.S. Asian territory is the only solution

An international military alliance is behind a move Monday by the United States to build giant anti-missile batteries in Japan -- a move China says smacks of colonialism and disregard for the country's sovereignty.

"I thought that Mitt Romney was a really tough guy," Jeff Roe said

He also attacked a comment Romney made during a 2012 Republican presidential debate

Mitt Romney called Donald Trump an insensitive bully during a debate Saturday.

On CNN's State of the Union, Trump's campaign chairman Jeff Roe huddled with Chris Wallace, who asked him about the comment, including why it was part of Romney's remarks two decades ago.

Roe said Trump is a strong supporter of military service and said Romney was wrong.

The Windows PowerShell Gallery allows you to view, install, and to run several PowerShell modules.

Get-Module -ListAvailable

When you get the list of modules available from the list, you can get a complete list of installed modules of this type. For example, a package installer can have multiple packages installed at a specific stage.

Get-Content cmdlet

Windows PowerShell automatically runs all the command at an interactive prompt. You can run some or all of the command as a script or as an executable that runs in default PowerShell.

This allows for option, performing power-related actions before entering PowerShell.
