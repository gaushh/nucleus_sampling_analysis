There is some sweetener in all the processed foods, but it's not quite as sweet as the other ingredients, so it has some health benefits, but it's not the main reason for the saturated fat in processed foods. Some health experts even say that the saturated fats in processed foods probably don't help wean people off of saturated fat. Rather, these foods help people adopt new eating habits that are better for heart health.
