Add another layer of substrate. Perhaps a plastic lawn or patio mat. Or a bed of newspapers can be added to water to provide extra heat.

This deck is a work in progress. There are a few things I plan to add soon but don't want to include just yet; 5 mana 10% damage win conditions that don't see as many in Ranked.


For now I'm at Rank 1, which is honestly not bad. It goes far, and after 4-5 games (2-4 minutes one) you'll become very good at the game. If you (like me) like the strategy of "kill everything with 10% damage", then you'll definitely like this set of cards. I just might play some of these decks in Ranked this season(~120 Ranked games this season so far)

The remark prompted Republican officials to trash Romney as a loser for failing to win the election and suggesting the Republican Party has an enabler in the president-elect.


Speaking on Smerconish's show, the governor called Romney 'a total loser' and sniped, 'I'm not going to get into a me-too argument -- far be it from me.'

Speaking on Smerconish's show, Romney called Romney 'a total loser' and sniped, 'I'm not going to get into a me-too argument -- far be it from me.'

Romney's critics, though, don't agree with the governor's tone but consider his argument that the Romney campaign ignored an election that was won.

Dr Anne Hidalgo, the barrister who wrote the New York Times column which accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct, also spoke out about the need for the press to'set a better standard'

Hidalgo said that sexual assault should be treated as 'nothing to be ashamed' of and that perpetrators should be 'acknowledged and dealt with'.

'That said, when I take those who commit such acts to task I do so for three reasons,' said Hidalgo, who said the second comes from her time on the board "of a sexual assault prevention and response organization".

She said that sexual assault often comes from a culture 'That one doesn't necessarily come instantly to someone because they are just no longer trying to control it,

According to the Daily Mail, the gunman who killed 10 people in Boston was apparently triggered to act by an online cartoon, depicting a Muslim man throwing a shoe at President Obama.

The Daily Mail reports The Daily Mail reports that the gunman who killed 10 people in Boston was apparently triggered to act by an online cartoon, depicting a Muslim man throwing a shoe at President Obama.

The Daily Mail says the cartoon, entitled Punishing America and entitled "Racism, Atheism and Boredom", appeared on the site of the cartoonist responsible for the "ludicrous" picture, Matt Furie.

Furie has publicly thanked fellow cartoonists in an online post on Saturday, in which he called the figure "My Little Pony".

McCarthy's testimony says that the alleged plot called for the publication of the "all-caps article" of the cartoon, referring to the "tasteless but ultimately hilarious" figure's throwing a shoe at the president,
