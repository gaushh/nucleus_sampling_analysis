(AP) — The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said it will approve the first drug that can effectively treat an infant with a form of epilepsy that's usually fatal.

The agency on Wednesday approved an orphan drug that's expected to treat a condition called alpha-fetoprotein. The drug, called PEG, targets a protein found in the brain that causes seizures and is linked to autism.

The FDA says the drug is not approved for other forms of epilepsy. Critics say the drug will be used to treat just the rare cases of infantile spasms.

The approval marks the first time an infant with an RGS has been treated with an orphan drug.

It's not like it's a game engine.


It's a game engine for cross-platform game development using C++ and SDL.


I spent a week trying to make a port of the game with SDL2 and it was a lot of work, so i would never try to port it with C++. In fact i'm not even sure it's possible.


I've tried to get devkits that are suitable for a port of the game but i can't find any (and I have only one devkit so far) that is capable of doing it.

But a court in Thessaloniki on Monday handed suspended seven-month prison sentences to two Muslim clerics after they took over prayers at a funeral service from a state-appointed preacher.
