And he was a soldier.

The news from Fort Hood shocked the nation. American soldiers shot on American soil. Thirteen dead and 38 injured. It was almost too terrible to believe. Almost.

The following is an excerpt from the book, The Last Refuge: The Rise of the Radical Right in America, by Mac Slavo.

The rise of the radical right in America is a story of two distinct but related movements. The first is the rise of the "alt-right," a loose network of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and other white supremacists who have embraced a "white identity" that is anti-Semitic, anti-immigrant, and anti-feminist. The second is the rise of the "alt-light," a loose network of white nationalists, neo-Nazis, and other white supremacists who have embraced a "white identity" that is pro-immigrant, pro-feminist, and pro-LGBTQ.

The rise of the "alt-right" is a story of two distinct but related movements.
