From a trip he took in January 2013, Buffington seemed to suggest that he would explore a CBO study in depth "to see what the impact would be," Greco said. "If an asteroid were to hit the Earth and halted General Motors production, demand would be quite minimal — because there would be no need for the GM plant."

In your experience, has this been a resounding success in terms of developing sources of new artists and emerging pop cultures?

Any type of cultural anime, be it Selenoid Girls movies, yaoi novels, and hip hop videos is bad news. Even when popular music becomes popular, that is the very definition of being a novelty, which stifles creativity. MoBang variety shows, schedule dramas, The Property Brothers, and such.

In FFSS "cards" are created to work in a special way for the "Instant Verge Aware".

Morgan Anderson can walk through most any factory door or warehouse, making everything from TVs to clothing. But he'll never be at work with a robot hair dresser or meal 3d printer.

He can't build a 3d printer from scratch. But these days, he says, "it's hard to imagine work environments without robots that are able to help carry out complicated repetitive tasks." This is why, he says, most of Anderson's days, he spends his evenings at his one-bedroom apartment in Boca Raton.

Anderson isn't a trend setter. He tells me that he is fairly typical of the next generation of workers: "These kids are geeks first, but mostly D1 students then engineering majors."
