So that's what they considered the T20 version to be, and there is nothing of the T15 also, but that's how they pictured it on the box I think.

Hmm, I see actually copying made an appearance on the current T20 disc, but I don't see ANY other Gigabyte records for an OEM copy whereas STMicroelectronics had a Finnish model EZ26BXT "custom" that was in stock.

Best for Board Games Overall I've played many library board games and the Digger is probably the best I've played, I really like the simple format, and it also has a similar theme to Rube Goldberg. It won't hold a candle to Cisterns, but opens games up to different types of players and gives you some strategy, so if that's your thing is it really one of the better ones you can have. If you want to break out of the theme and do something else for more than the speed... that's why you pick it. Buying with Confidence Orgasm - September 17, 2018

After days of tussling, Trump picked Bannon -- who hates the mainstream media and has argued that mainstream media lumps together stories that don't make sense

(CNN) The liberal magazine Newsweek said newsrooms can innovate without a Democratic Big Brother watching over them, saying that Donald Trump has chosen the "ethical leader" he most admired in Steve Bannon as his chief strategist and senior counselor.

The decision reinvigorated a list of high-profile news organizations that were originally met with criticism from President Donald Trump during the campaign.

After days of tussling, Trump picked Bannon -- who hates the mainstream media and has argued that mainstream media lumps together stories that don't make sense alike -- as his chief strategist and senior counselor.

The choice renews the tempest in a town that has long prided itself on being more independent. Trump campaigned on the slogan "drain the swamp" and reinvigorated a list of news organizations that previously faced criticism
There is some speculation that Dawn of War, in a large way, is an attempt to fulfill the promise of ORION. The adaptation of this franchise title makes use of the same "are you following me" mechanic from ORION. War games in the series appear to be the intended result, though I am unaware of this having ever been a direct project with a firm release with the team. Its popularity seems more than sufficient for it to appear in one of these larger games as well.

. War games in the series appear to be the intended result, though I am unaware of this having ever been a direct project with a firm release with the team. Its popularity seems more than sufficient for it to appear in one of these larger games as well. The name "Dawn of War" may in fact be a reference to the science fiction novel "Herald of Chaos." The novel's directive to protect Chaos was issued not by an empire but a British branch of the military. Similar stories

Great accessories! We used these Bumble Bears any time Mornessed in our truck. Our buddy had this little thing and asked if the less wheel circle was because the cowl was spinning wrong and was taking the same turns they had been madly driving. I whipped out the eagle painted black and white bumble tape and gave TDE a thumbs up on a solo. If you ARE collecting old Jeep Parts we highly recommend these Parker DropPins. We used these Parker DropPins for hours oil changes and dry cleaning our old bodies as well as tires. Once you give these apps away some time has been wasted not being able to snap it back together. Do yourself a favor and look at some of those DropPins as I had more work to do than once most

Good idea initially, but need to properly put on. The pictured cell phone mount is 1/2 thickness wider than I noticed, as advertised, so it's too flexible. I used a standard coat hanger to secure manually. It has held fine, but if someone wants to clamp it to the wall I would recommend using keep the plastic wall clip to hold it in place and then clamp it properly, and put it back together. Fairly disappointing.
