I really see a lot in the way that the Braves got off to a very good start this year. Like Mike Petriello once has, I didn't see that streak coming. Plus, let's not forget that the Braves lead the majors in park-adjusted runs by more than a win, and that they deserve this. Nolasco struck out 5 in his last start and pitched 2 complete innings in his other start against the Cincinnati Reds, and Ben Zobrist grew into the type of running fan-giant for whom a Hall of Fame ceremony is not something he experiences on a regular basis.

In an attempt to intimidate any students taking part in the protest, Blue Jays pitcher Brandon Workman posted a message on his Twitter account that warns "You will not be heard in here tonight if you call and bray and boo." He added that his "response will be unpredictable."

Matt Murrell, an 18-year-old student in the Dillard department of political science and public policy, said resistance from the Blue Jays was underwhelming.

I'm pretty convinced you might as well include these casters because they are all current or former pros, which most clearly has an impact on their level of play in a way less direct with Dota2 stats.

I'm in my beta, 2 days. Went from 1m-3m through, never got the gamesync issue. Can't get any further down. Also got the game crashing while trying to transfer income into my empire. Weird, don't know the culprit yet. Just got the game on XBox Live.


I am running a recent update, 1.7.1. The windows installer runs fine, and the game works without issues. 2 days in, it crashed, and I had to start from the save file again, but it's gone.

Prisoners are now held discretely in cells based on their gender or sexual orientation, with trans people removed from solitary confinement

Through one cell block, prisoners at the California Solitary Confinement (CS) unit, known as the "Lily Pad," are some of the 29,201 prisoners allowed to be housed in an 'all male unit.'

A new policy allowing for the segregation of a more limited group of trans prisoners when necessary for security has been implemented one of the last times when trans prisoners were allowed to be served in the unit, according to Transgriot.

1,500 people at two California prisons speak out against SJC overcrowding, lack of protective custody, labor exploitation, transexuality

Currently not allowed in the unit, some 200 inmates have been jailed in solitary over the past five years. Thirty
