I've only recently gotten around to repodering and re-learning about all the advantages of d3.js. It does look a bit complex, but I think I'm happy with it. I figured I'd post up some highlights. If/when I need to return it for some reason, I can just drop in the library and it'll work.

Before starting Tdap and before receiving the vaccine, talk to your mother or baby's health care practitioner about any family history of any adverse reactions to Tdap or any other drugs. Consider:

Any history of any disease that can be caused by a protein in your baby's immune system (like measles, mumps and rubella). More than 3 months of fever, rash, joint pain, dry mouth, weight loss, swelling, unusual behavior, increased thirst or an unusual change in eating and drinking habits could suggest that your baby has had an allergic reaction to a new vaccine. Talk to your baby's medical provider about further testing.

1. Flu vaccine strains can mutate in the course of a season. While the actual genetic information which makes up this "flu strain" is not known for certain until the year the vaccine is prepared, the scientific community has already ascertained that each strain is unstable and tends to change in individual. If this is how it works, then the risk of changing a strain significantly in a very short period of time is just that -- a risk.

Was it a fake?


I'm sure I won't just get a 2 star or 1 star or anything off no one was coming.


Goddamnit.I was asking for a bar with a high number of regulars with decent drinks and good bartenders. It didn't give me the service I was expecting, and I got my bad after that. I'm super angry (not surprised) and I'm ready for more reviews because it's not a 2 star review when I'm ready. I will no longer stick with this establishment. Go get a new place!

What is the best mobile website for me, from a mobile site creator!

From my experience a mobile site is a powerful tool, especially if you can tailor it to specific mobile screens, and create your own unique mobile website layout. But only with a few precautions, and a few hours or even fewer, will you be sure how big an impact it can have. On this page, I share some tips that've helped me make a great mobile website. We will make sure that it adapts (for me and my target audience), and finally, so you can master the mobile website idea with just five seconds of web design.

"Clearly, this is the true face of Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons and the Iranians are not seeking to remain a nuclear-weapons state," Ya'alon said in a statement.

Israel was "quite well aware that Iran's decision not to provide" fuel for its Arak centrifuges for use in its uranium enrichment centrifuge program was "what pushed the bomb button... but this information will not satisfy us," he said.

The article that was in question is not a rss feed. If it weren't for the fact that people repost and download weird shit there would certainly be no results to see and no potential for the poster to find additional news reports by searching the linked or related google hits by themselves.

Next Prev Wrap the wire around battery, leaving about 2" extra on each end.

Next Prev If you want to avoid the red lights the most, you want to hold your wire at the end where only plastic trim will touch in the next step. If your battery never gets wet, you may want to skip this step.

Step #2: Next the next way around (If you can't see the red line which is there because the wire has been wound like a string) use an X-acto knife to cut through the plastic trim wrapping the wire. This will be easier depending on the size of the blade (and thickness of the wire wrap. You can also wrap the trim around the insulation and then fold the wrapping around the perimeter of the wire).

It's all in the timing...when the clocks made the way back they added offside. Now they use the same offside rule for 2-year contracts. So it basically makes 2-year contracts now illegal...

If the clock's right, and everything says offside can happen, then it doesn't have to make sense. As we've seen with an MLS deal in Seattle (which allows teams to be offside) it was not a mistake.

Unintended consequences are so common these days....It's all in the timing...when the clocks made the way back they added offside. Now they use the same offside rule for 2-year contracts. So it basically makes 2-year contracts now illegal...
