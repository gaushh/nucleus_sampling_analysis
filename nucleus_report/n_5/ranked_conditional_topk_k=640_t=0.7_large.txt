Great PSU Review by J

Price Value Quality I bought this power supply for my new system. It is awesome. I went with the 80 PLUS Gold (with the ATX12V cable) and my system ran at 70% power draw which is great. It also does not have any fans. I also installed a single 12V rail and I'm getting 40A of power from the PSU. I'm happy.

Inauguration events kicked off Wednesday with a parade of floats, bands, and floats that symbolized the incoming and outgoing presidents as they took their seats at the Capitol.

The parade began in the far west end of the Capitol, where a military band played traditional marches and patriotic music. The parade moved east to the Capitol lawn to include the American flag, a drum circle, and another military band.
