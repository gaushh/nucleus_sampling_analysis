The vote came after a series of amendments were offered by Democrats, including one that would have repealed the individual mandate.

"I am disappointed that the House has failed to pass this amendment," Conyers said in a statement. "I will continue to work with my colleagues to ensure that the American people have access to affordable health care."

In the wake of the attacks, President Obama has called for a "meaningful" debate on gun control. But the issue has been a major source of contention in the Republican presidential primary, with candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio arguing that the government should not be able to restrict gun ownership.
