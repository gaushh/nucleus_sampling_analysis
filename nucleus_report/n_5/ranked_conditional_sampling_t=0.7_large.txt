Sorry for the bad link. If I'm not mistaken, that thread was a good start to getting more people talking about these topics. I'm not saying you need to do that in every thread, but you should be talking about it more often. Sorry for the bad link.

The DPRK's state-sponsored media are known for their war-like rhetoric and defamatory news, and are larger in number than those of, say, Saudi Arabia, both in terms of the number of journalists and the number of analysts and editors. There seems to be a trend away from the more traditional front-page, highly stylized coverage of the DPRK's political and economic activities in recent years—and towards more detailed, written, and balanced coverage.

Dangerous and fantastic, it's one of the best romantic novels I've read. But, even as I read it, I was also thinking of it in the context of my own marriage.

If it was like this when you were still in school, you'd have had to take it up with your parents. I remember I had to take it up with my parents though, because after a while I got a feeling and was like, "I think this is just fine." And that's how I learned to play. If you're a non-musician, that's a little different. If you're a musician, you might be a little more close to the original.

The newly proposed rule, published in the Federal Register, would require calorie labels on food packages sold in the United States. The label would have calorie information on the front of the package and would have a calculation function on the back. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has the power to require calorie labeling on packages sold to consumers in the United States.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has the power to require calorie labeling on packages sold to consumers in the United States. That would be a big win for calorie counting. But if you're not a food distributor and you sell to retailers, it's much harder to get the label on your product.
