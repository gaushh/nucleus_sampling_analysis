Read a mathematical formula in Haskell, and apply "Some" or "All", or substitute "e" for another singleton variable. Write it down and use "Any".

Much as a Stanford undergraduate might always find some way to write a class when they come across a theorem, the Haskell developer has at least one standard implementation for many of the basic operations. "Any" and "Any" would hardly be worth it. When a multidimensional list is filtered, it is good to be a lazy valver in Haskell.

Here they are. Trump said he has been in consultation with Pence about the decision. "I have been in conversations with Mike Pence on a range of issues, and I will continue to talk to him as necessary about some of these issues — no plans to sit down with him any more today on this subject," he said, adding he would meet with many more leaders next week.

Pence responded on Twitter with a jab at Trump's critics, tweeting, "Many folks wanted to make a killing raising boogeyman tales about Trump. The world's greatest dealmaker took it upon himself to take on the bogeyman, remain true to his values, and drive forward positive change. His hard work has paid off."

Donald Trump told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on Friday that he is serious about his pledge to accept the election results

Scarborough: "Why not?"

Trump: "He's a nobody in this race. He doesn't have any strength in the polls."

Donald Trump told MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on Friday that he is serious about his pledge to accept the election results -- something he insisted would be unthinkable if Clinton has a win on November 8.

"He's a nobody in this race. He doesn't have any strength in the polls," Trump said. "I'm not going to let the election be rigged, OK?"

At the same time, Trump also went after the leader of the opposition.

Scarborough: "Why not, Mike?"

Trump: "He was a nobody two years ago, two years ago. He didn't have a lot of chance two years ago, two years ago. I agree with him 100% on that and
But the preacher, Nikos Nicolaou, could be arrested again on Sunday.

During the session, it emerged that at least 20 state officials used religious organisations as tools to exert control over Greek Orthodox church congregations in public spaces.

Reuters - A judge in Thessaloniki on Monday handed suspended seven-month prison sentences to two Muslim clerics after they took over prayers at a funeral service from a state-appointed preacher.

But the preacher, Nikos Nicolaou, could be arrested again on Sunday.

During the session, it emerged that at least 20 state officials used religious organisations as tools to exert control over Greek Orthodox church congregations in public spaces.

Neither judicial nor parliamentary procedures were applied during the trial, which began on June 11 when Greece had been hit by the worst financial crisis since the Second World War.

The two were charged with "contempt of the clergy" by the same court which has recently taken a harder line in dealing with

At first glance it seems like a remake of crash in 1995, in which Russian KLM plane was shot down by Ukraine's now demonized Kiev. Not only MH17 but even Airbus A319, missing in flight in 2010, was also shot down by pro-Russia separatists. Fun fact: on the list of Israeli airliners used by Mossad to fly covert ops in Syria in the 1980s and early 1990s, is it true that "Aviation Israel of Israel Airlines" (for to name only the first 9 planes) is at the top?

Early was visiting his aunt, who paid him $50 for the return of the sneakers

Police were told that he had previously stolen the exact same shoes from a store

The 16-year-old was arrested shortly after he allegedly left the home with the sneakers

An arrest has been made in the disappearance of a 16-year-old boy who was stealing shoes in Lakewood, Pennsylvania, which prompted the police department to obtain a search warrant for a nearby home Thursday morning.

Police identified the 16-year-old boy as Cleanthony Early, police said.

Early was visiting his aunt, who paid him $50 for the return of the shoes, authorities said. They said he had previously stolen the exact same shoes from a store hours earlier.

Two days later, authorities said he entered his aunt's house on Salem Street in Lakewood, Pennsylvania, and allegedly removed three sneakers from a locked closet.

One major cause of frost-bite and open wounds is hypothermia in the winter months when body temperatures plummet from 36C to around 25C.

Those conditions have been caused by "non-contact" environments and therefore don't necessarily have to be involved.

Proper seasonal clothing can mitigate the effect of cold, but care must be taken.

Frostbite and open wounds frequently develop following trauma - car accidents for example or severe infection.

No or maybe maybe not, it could be very bulky and can be hard to maneuver, possibly unbalanced. The two lower blades are probably used for a purpose beyond the backwheel. Seems I'll have to have a look at it.

On consoles, it is in the BIOS. It is almost always very low.

PVDSV gives a wide range of options regarding video memory and it's usage, but the amount and format of the video memory varies by platform. There are multiple variants available for each platform.

Like MiBO, VOD are capable of displaying CPU usage; just different combinations of transmission methods. For example, in VOD mode, the streaming streams are always interrupted by the MSU interrupt polling event. The relevant ISRs, and the interrupt transition logic, are different for each frame in a VOD. VOD GFF format is significantly different from VOD AVQ format, leading to a different display profile (PVDSV for MPEG2 HD video, VOD AVQ for MPEG2 720 video).
