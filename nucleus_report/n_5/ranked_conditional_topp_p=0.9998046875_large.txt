Lol, this is so great. I knew her distressed red outfit was going to say "Je suis jazz" to the point of being obnoxious... but I never realized how perfect the expression is on the clothes. I wanted to make it more like a red and black but first you have to block in the eyes. Lol, this is so great.

The cancer topographic map above shows the 10 cancers most frequently seen in US young men (48 percent) and among young adult female patients (44 percent). Those are the most aggressive cancers, so it's perhaps unsurprising that 82 percent of men and 73 percent of women had one of the 10 cancers or had at least one metastatic cancer. These findings are in line with a two-year study started in 2014 that found the rate of progression of the majority of the cancer types increased.

Alcohol and diet predict cancer risks. Prostate cancer rates rose from 234 a year in America's oldest residents to second place in young adults in just 15 years - 1998 to 2015. Though these data don't show what nutritional factors increase cancer risk.

Trump and Melania joined some 23,000 congregants at Penfield United Methodist Church in Palm Beach, Fla. as festive music played and decorations for Christmas were laid out.

Some members of the church were wearing Santa Claus costumes, while others slithered on stilts.

Members of the congregation sang hymns, handed out turkey, pulled Christmas trees, planted smart chocolate trees and plump Santa hats.

The Sunday service was the first time the incoming President and First Lady have attended services at the church since Trump announced that he was running for president in June 2015.
