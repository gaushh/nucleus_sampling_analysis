This year's Oscars were an odd mixture of dark comedy and Oscar bait. The entire season was built on the premise that the Academy is filled with a bunch of smart, successful people who don't know what they're doing, and that their ideas are somehow lacking.

But the whole thing was so bizarre and self-defeating that the most memorable moments were probably the ones that made it all seem so clear.

"I'm pretty shocked," Keefer told The Huffington Post. "We had no idea that there were so many. I'm so grateful for all the people who have donated to the shelter and have helped us find homes for so many of these dogs."
