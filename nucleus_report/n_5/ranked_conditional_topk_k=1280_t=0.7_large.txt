I had a similar experience with my previous dogs, and due to them being so smart, they could figure out where I was, and when I was walking them. I also have a younger dog, who's got a lot of potential. She just needs to get stronger so she can get better at the basic tasks, not just how to do a task, but how to do it well.

I've read everything from first-hand accounts to very basic guides - I even used some guides from the forum to help me in my first years of play. Thanks for posting it again, I really appreciate it.

Gregg Can anyone confirm that the speed has changed? I've read somewhere that the speed on the Aussie roadways has increased by about 2 miles per hour during the past 20 years.


I would also recall a review on speed increases in the USA where speed was measured in mph, not km/h.


I can confirm that the current "national speed limit", in most places, is about 3 mph above the current national average of about 20 mph.
