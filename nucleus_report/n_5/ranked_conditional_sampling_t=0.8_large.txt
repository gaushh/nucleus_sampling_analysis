It has a slight nod to The Poop, which is funky and subtle, but a lot of people would argue it isn't quite as unique as the other four. It is also unusual, in that you can get it in the same place you get the Dragon Bone, and has no materials.

Example:

This is the 4th random value from the random generator.

Add some checks. For example:
