Quality Price Value I bought this swiss watch to replace a Rolex Submariner. The watch itself is just fine. The case is nice and solid and the bracelet is very comfortable.

The following is a list of cards with their corresponding color.

Blue

Wormwood Hero – 3

Wormwood Hero is a premium card. It's a good card to use in constructed decks, and it's better than the other premium cards in the set. You can use it in your deck during the first few turns of the game, when you don't have any other cards that can give you 3 items, but you should never keep it in your deck for the rest of the game.

Green

I've been posting little mini comics about life in France in the wake of my departure from the comic shop that I've been working at for the last four years. This is just one of them.

I hope you enjoy these little videos as much as I enjoyed making them.

You can find the rest of my French comics on my Tumblr.

UPDATE:

I've just posted the first chapter of my comic book series! It's called The French Rodeo.

The French Rodeo is a collaboration of my friends and I, and I'm really excited to share it with the world.

The overall design is so similar to the original Stratocaster that it is easy to confuse the two in the marketplace.

The Stratocaster is available exclusively for the Stratocaster "Hardcore" edition guitar (no, not the original "Hardcore" Stratocaster).
